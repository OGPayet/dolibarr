= Usage =

== Setup ==
All services of this module use the Yousign API. So you must have an Yousign (www.yousign.com) account.

Go on Dolibarr module setup, DoliEsign setup, tab "Settings", and add your account credentials:

<pre>
* Yousign login
* Yousign password
* Yousign API key
* Default authentication mode for the document signers, default is 'sms'
</pre>

You can change the default authentication mode into 'mail', the document signer will now have to validate his signature with an email instead of an sms.
You can still change the authentication mode when sending the signing request.

In your user permission page you can set rights for reading, creating and deleting the electronic signatures.

== Configuration ==
Goto tools->DoliEsign->Configuration List

</div>

Click on the configuration number you want to modify and click the modify button.

</div>

You can change following configurations depending on the type of document to sign.
* The status of the configuration defines if signing for this type of document is available or not. It's advised only to enable signing when required.
* The default contact type who needs to sign the document.
* The location of the signature on the pdf document. On the configuration card there is a link to a tool to calculate the location coordinates.

If you have multiple configurations for a document, you will have multiple signers of the document. Like the default for interventions.

== Request email configuration ==
In the dolibarr email setup page you can configure the email templates used for sending and confirming the electronic signing requests.
The emails are send by the Yousign service but the content can be defined in the email templates configuration.

<div class="divforimgcentpercent">
[[File:DoliEsign_email_template_list.png]]
</div>

The template must contain a field called {yousignUrl}, this field will be replaced by the document signing link.
Also the other standard substitution field for email templates can be used.
There is also a __LOGO__ substitution field which will be replaced by you company logo to deliver professional looking emails that seem to send by you and not by the Yousign service.
